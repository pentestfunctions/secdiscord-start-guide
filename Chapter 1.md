## Understanding Computer Hardware:

Computers are complex machines, but understanding their core components and how they interact with each other can be incredibly enlightening. Below are the major components that are crucial for a computer's operation:

1. **Motherboard**:
    
    - The motherboard is essentially the heart of the computer. It houses the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and other crucial components, and allows them to communicate with each other through a set of circuits.
2. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:
    
    - Often regarded as the brain of the computer, the CPU executes instructions from software by performing basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations.
3. **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**:
    
    - The GPU, also known as a video card or graphics card, is responsible for rendering images and videos to be displayed on the monitor. It's especially important for gaming, video editing, and other graphics-intensive tasks.
4. **Power Supply**:
    
    - The power supply unit (PSU) converts electrical energy from an outlet into a usable form for the computer. It distributes power to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and other components.
5. **CMOS Battery**:
    
    - The CMOS battery powers the BIOS firmware on the motherboard, retaining system time and settings even when the computer is turned off.
6. **CPU Fan**:
    
    - The CPU fan is crucial for keeping the CPU cool, as processing operations generate heat. Overheating can cause the CPU to throttle its performance or shut down to prevent damage.
7. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
    
    - RAM is the computer's short-term memory, storing data and instructions that are currently in use, which allows for quick access and execution by the CPU.
8. **Hard Drive**:
    
    - The hard drive is where all data is stored permanently. There are three main types:
        - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Uses magnetic storage, generally has higher capacity and lower cost but slower speed.
        - **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Uses flash memory, offering faster speed but at a higher cost per GB.
        - **M.2 SSD**: A compact form of SSD that connects directly to the motherboard, offering very high-speed data access.

When choosing a hard drive, consider the balance between speed, capacity, and cost. For instance, many users opt for a smaller capacity SSD for installing the operating system (booting system) and frequently used programs, paired with a larger capacity HDD for storing other data. This setup aims to achieve a good balance between speed and storage capacity.

By understanding each of these components and how they contribute to the overall operation of a computer, you can better appreciate the complexity and elegance of computer systems. Moreover, this knowledge is foundational for delving into more advanced topics in robotics and cybersecurity.

It's important to note that some computers have AIO or "All in one" coolers. These are for water cooling for your CPU instead of your standard fan that sits on top of your CPU. In short they have a radiator style system connected to some fans and some tubes. The tubes will be filled with the liquid used to transfer heat away from your CPU. As your CPU heats up, that heat is carried away by heating up the liquid and that liquid is distributed into the radiator. The radiator separates the distance between the water allowing it to cool before being sent back to your CPU to repeat the process.

This is the same system/base concept for all water cooling. For a full system, you would generally have a separate pump in your PC case to help increase the rate at which the liquid is carried away, while the reservoirs hold the amount of liquid your system can utilize for heat management. GPUs will require a separate plate attachment and you will need to unscrew and remove the current metal plate and replace it with one that allows for liquid to safely be contained and pass over the GPU to remove heat. 

Before we delve into virtual machines, it's important to note what the term "post" means.  In computer terms, this means that when you turn on your computer it reaches the "BIOS" which is the firmware used by the motherboard. It gives access to finetune your system and decides what hard drive to look for your Windows, what type of graphics card you have and all the other goodies.
