### Techniques to Learn:

**Local File Inclusion (LFI):** This is an attack where the attacker tricks the application into exposing or running files on a server. Search for tutorials on websites like OWASP, HackTricks, or security-focused blogs.

**File upload bypass:** This technique involves bypassing security measures to upload malicious files to a server. Look for guides on penetration testing websites or cybersecurity forums.

**Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Similar to LFI, but the file is included remotely. Resources for learning RFI can be found on security education platforms and penetration testing guides.

**Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on a target machine. Tutorials and guides can be found on various cybersecurity educational platforms.

**SQL Injection (SQLi):** A type of attack that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. OWASP and other security resources have extensive guides on preventing and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Reading robots.txt and source code:** This is a technique for gathering information about a website by analyzing its robots.txt file and the source code of its web pages. Look for resources on website reconnaissance and information gathering.

**Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. OWASP, and various security blogs have comprehensive guides on XSS.

**Privilege Escalation:** This involves exploiting a vulnerability in a system to gain unauthorized access or permissions. Resources can be found on penetration testing platforms, security blogs, and forums.

### Additional Learning Resources:

These are direct links to various educational platforms, forums, and YouTube channels that focus on cybersecurity and hacking. You can visit these sites directly.

- **Programming Languages:** Knowing Python, Bash, and understanding website structure is crucial in cybersecurity. Look for programming tutorials on websites like Codecademy, W3Schools, or YouTube channels dedicated to coding.
    
- **Tampermonkey:** A popular userscript manager. You can find documentation and usage guides on its official website.
    
- **Server side vs Client side:** Understand the difference and security implications. W3Schools, Mozilla Developer Network, and other web development resources have articles on this topic.
    
- **Slaves/Botnets, RATs, Crypters, OSINT, Leaked Databases, Steganography, WiFi Hacking, Man in the Middle, Google Dorking, Bug Bounties, Blue/Red/Purple Teams, DDoS/DoS, CORS, SSRF, HTTP Methods, 403 Bypassing, Cloudflare Bypassing, DNS History, Subdomain Takeover, Phishing, Zero-day, CVE/CWE, PoC:** All of these topics can be studied through cybersecurity courses, tutorials, books, blogs, forums, and specific articles dedicated to each subject.

Yes images (pngs and jpg) files can contain secrets hidden inside them, including entire extra images or archive/zip/rar files.

Learning how to use github and git clone will come in handy, so i'll throw that in here too - installing deb files:
dpkg -i filename.deb

I want to leave it as open ended as possible as once you have read all of these chapters, you should have enough information and to now use google and AI to assist in your learning, as well as give everyone in the Owlsec voice chat an easier time in assisting you!
